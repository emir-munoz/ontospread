@article{Collins_Loftus_1975, title={A spreading activation theory of semantic processing}, volume={82}, 
url={http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/82/6/407}, 
abstractNote={Presents a spreading-activation theory of human semantic processing, which can be applied to a wide range of recent experimental results. The theory is based on M. R. Quilliantextquoterights (1967) theory of semantic memory search and semantic preparation, or priming. In conjunction with this, several misconceptions concerning Quilliantextquoterights theory are discussed. A number of additional assumptions are proposed for his theory to apply it to recent experiments. The present paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production experiments by E. F. Loftus, J. F. Juola and R. C. Atkinsontextquoterights (1971) multiple-category experiment, C. Conradtextquoterights (1972) sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by K. J. Holyoak and A. L. Glass (1975), L. J. Rips et al (1973), and E. Rosch (1973). The paper also provides a critique of the Rips et al model for categorization judgments.}, number={6}, journal={Psychological Review}, author={AM.

A key issue in this area is how to discover user's interest and behavior effectively. In this paper we investigate an approach to recommendation system based on user ontology and spreading activation model. Through combining the user ontology and spreading activation model, the capability of discovering of user's potential interests is enhanced. A prototype system is also developed base on this methodology.}",

  abstract = {The Semantic Desktop is a means to support users in Personal Information
	Management (PIM). It provides an excellent test bed for Semantic
	Web technology: resources (e. g., persons, projects, messages, documents)
	are distributed amongst multiple systems, ontologies are used to
	link and annotate them. Finding information is a core element in
	PIM. For the end user, the search interface has to be intuitive
	to use, natural language queries provide a simple mean to express
	requests. State of the art semantic search engines focus on fact
	retrieval or on semantic document retrieval. We combine both approaches
	to search the Semantic Desktop exploiting all available information.
	Our semantic search engine, built on semantic teleporting and spreading
	activation, is able to answer natural language queries with facts,
	e. g., a specific phone number, and/or relevant documents. We evaluated
	our approach on ESWC 2007 data in comparison with Google site search.}
